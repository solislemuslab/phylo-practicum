# Downloading the data

The authors of the paper made data publicly available in a clean manner in this [data repository](https://www.agap-ge2pop.org/wheat-relative-history/).

We will download the [Wheat_Relative_History_Data_Glemin_et_al.zip](https://www.agap-ge2pop.org/wp-content/uploads/WheatRelativeHistory/download/Wheat_Relative_History_Data_Glemin_et_al.zip) and move it into our `data` subfolder.

The authors uploaded the alignments, rather than raw data for us to assemble and align.
