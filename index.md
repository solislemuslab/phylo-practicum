# PlantPath 875: Phylogenetic Practicum (UW-Madison)

A course in the practice of phylogenetic inference from DNA sequence data. Students will practice all the steps of state-of-the-art phylogenomic analyses with hands-on weekly activities.

- Spring 2026: Friday 10:00-10:50am
- Instructors: 
    - Claudia Solis-Lemus, PhD 
    - Josh Justison, PhD
- Office hours: By appointment


## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to
1. Reproduce all the steps of a phylogenomics data analysis of a published paper
2. Learn best computing and reproducibility practices for phylogenomic data analyses



## Schedule 2026

[Tentative.] Schedule will be updated after specific paper is selected.
